# Window_Display
# About:
# The backlight in my monitor broke so I dismantled it and put the lcd layer in my window. Without the rest of the monitor, the lcd layer is semi-transparent. I hooked a Raspberry Pi to the window display so I can display whatever I want. I am currently making this program so I don't have to manually display the images.


# What works:
# It rotates, scales, and displays images
# Automatically checks this github repo for changes in the background
# Installs dependancies

# To-DO:
# Use the google drive api to check for new images on my google drive
# Add relay and button to shut off the display and backlight when I want to go to sleep
# Pre-process the images
# Get gifs working
# Get videos working
