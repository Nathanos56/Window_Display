# Window_Display
About:
The backlight in my monitor broke so I dismantled it and put the LCD layer in my window. Without the rest of the monitor, the lcd layer is semi-transparent. I hooked a Raspberry Pi to the window display so I could display whatever I wanted. I am currently making this program so I don't have to manually display the images.


To-DO:
- [x] It rotates, scales, and displays images
- [x] Automatically checks this GitHub repo for changes in the background
- [x] Installs dependencies
- [ ] Use the Google Drive API to check for new images on my Google Drive
- [ ] Add a relay and button to shut off the display and backlight when I want to go to sleep
- [ ] Pre-process the images
- [ ] Get gifs working
- [ ] Get videos working
